### Want to use my config? There it is

#### ZSH

I use starship theme is zsh among with zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting, and fzf plugins. Clean and simple.

#### Vim

Because I use the Vim mostly for editing and develop in Python, I decided only use a few plugins.
I use Prettier as html, css and JavaScript formatter, Black as Python formatter, and Ruff as diagnostics
tool, all through ALE plugin.

I though using Tokyonight as colorscheme but the main Vim repo is now achived, so instead of it I am
trying now the catppuccin colorscheme, it looks nice and have four options of color palettes.

I used a statusline based on the configuration used by the FreeCodeCamp article about .vimrc
([see more here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vimrc-configuration-guide-customize-your-vim-editor/))

My original .vimrc contained more than four hundred lines, now I am trying to narrow that in one hundred lines.
You don't need to use every plugin you think is useful, only those who will support your tasks and make things
get done, remember that.
