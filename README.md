### Want to use my config? There it is

#### ZSH

I use starship theme is zsh among with zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting, and fzf plugins.
Clean and simple.

#### Vim

I tried to keep it simple, but while I still trying to find what is really usefull for my workflow I 
will try everything and then I will think in a clean setup.

I though using Tokyonight as colorscheme but the main Vim repo is now achived, so instead of it I am
trying now the catppuccin colorscheme, it looks nice and have four options of color palettes.

I like to use as statusline the lightline plugin, if you like airline few free to change.
